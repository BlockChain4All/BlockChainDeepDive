		- Using Assertions during the testing
	Readymade Networks
		- configuring Infura for the application
		- deploy to Infura based Rinkeby network
	
Week7:

	Advanced Smart Contracts
		- The Lottery Application
		- getting acquainted with Solidity Data Types
			- basic data types (int, uint, string etc)
			- complex data types (Arrays, Struct,Mappings, Address etc)
		- using payable methods to accept Ether payments
		- using require to notate minimum payment associated
		- debugging using Remix		
		
	Identify the ICO projects and white papers that the team is interested to be picked up for Week 8
	
	BlockChain news cast for sharing with in the team	
	
	Identify the basics for BlockChain Conceptual Foundation
		- How does an actual Block look like on Ethereum
			- how does a transaction flow into the network and a structure
		- Merkle Trees on Ethereum
		- How Consensus actually happens on Ethereum BlockChain
			- How is difficulty level arrived at by the platform
		- How a getMessage read data from BlockChain

Week8:

	Advanced Smart Contracts
		- using try-catch in Solidity
	Developing a DApp
		-How to make FrontEnd that can interact with Ethereum BlockChain/SmartContracts deployed in Rinkeby
	Accessing Smart Contract Properties
		
	
	Building deeper understanding of concepts like MerkleTrees
	
	Discuss about 3 identified White Papers for popular ICOs
	


Week9:

	Building a Voting System using Ethereum[Course, Module5]
	Interact with Smart Contracts developed by other team members
	Refactoring Solidity code
	Building deeper understanding of concepts like MerkleTrees
	Discuss about 3 more identified White Papers for Popular ICOs
	Discuss about ideas that we can pickup for doing an ICO

--------
Month 3 (May):

Week10:
	Setting up Ethereum Project Infra-structure[Course]
	Advanced Multi-page front ends [Course]
	End to End testing using Ethereum [Course]	
	Writing Solidity code for ICOs & DA ICOs
	Ideas BrainStorming
	Initial Draft for the White Paper

Week11:

	Finalize the code launch of an ICO
		Implement a ERC 20 or ERC 23 Token
	Finalize the Draft White Paper
	How to promote for the ICO	

Week12:

	Launch an ICO (This is for club member loyalty token) by the time we meet on May 26
	
		Publish a White Paper
		Answer questions like:
			Who mines our Tokens or how we can give incentive for people
			How valuation from our Token translates into Ether			
		How to launch a Token Sale
		Implement a website that promote how the token works
		How to list the Token on exchanges like Binance or Bittrex
		
Month 4 (June):
---------------
 
	When we meet on June 2
	Start taking up a real world problem like Implement Voting using BlockChain for Hyderabad City
	We can do better on taking any real world problem which solves a real problem

Month 5 (July):
---------------

Month 6 (August):
-----------------

	Successfully complete a full scale production solution, on Ethereum BlockChain when we meet on August 25
